# AI Coding Challenge — First Principles Engineer

## Purpose

This is a short, open-ended coding challenge.

It is **not** intended to test completeness, polish, or framework knowledge.

The goal is to understand how you:

- Interpret an ambiguous problem
- Make trade-offs under time constraints
- Use AI tools while coding
- Decide what is “enough”

---

## Timebox

**30 minutes total**, including thinking and coding.

Please do not exceed this timebox.

---

## Task

Build a **very small working prototype** that performs the following task:

> Given a **Job Description** and a **Candidate CV**, produce a short screening summary for a hiring manager.

The summary should help answer:

- Is this candidate a fit for the role?
- What are the key risks or unknowns?
- What should the interviewer focus on next?

The exact implementation is entirely up to you.

---

## What You Decide

You are free to choose:

- Programming language (Python preferred, but not required)
- Structure and architecture
- Whether to call a real LLM or mock it
- Prompts and data format
- Level of abstraction
- How minimal or extended the solution is

There is **no “correct” solution**.

---

## Example Input

### Job Description

Senior Python Backend Engineer  
Experience with distributed systems, APIs, and AI workflows preferred.

### Candidate CV

- 5 years Python backend experience  
- Built REST APIs using FastAPI and PostgreSQL  
- Some exposure to LLM APIs and prompt engineering  

---

## Output

Any structured output format is acceptable (e.g. JSON, Markdown).

The output should clearly include:

- A brief candidate summary
- Strengths vs the job requirements
- Potential risks or gaps
- Suggested interview questions

---

## AI Tools

Use of AI coding tools is **explicitly encouraged**.

We are interested in **how you use AI**, not whether you use it.

---

## Screen Recording (Required)

Please record your screen while working on the challenge.

The recording should show:

- How you interpret the task
- How you use AI tools during coding
- How you make decisions or trade-offs
- Running the final result (even if minimal)

A **10–15 minute recording** is sufficient.

> This recording is the most important deliverable.

---

## Deliverables

1. The code (repository or zip)  
2. The screen recording  
3. (Optional) a short README or spoken explanation in the video  

---

## Evaluation Criteria

We will focus on:

- Problem framing and clarity of thinking
- Decision-making under constraints
- Effective use of AI as a coding and reasoning partner
- Coherence and extensibility of the solution
- Ability to stop at an appropriate level of scope

---

## Notes

This challenge is intentionally minimal.

Choosing what **not** to build is part of the evaluation.
